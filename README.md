General Idea
Your starting point for this assignment will be the code in the examples/Lecture59 folder.

Your task is fairly simple.

First, change the 2 buttons at the top of the website to say My Info and Sign Up instead of About and Awards.

Task 1: When the user clicks on the Sign Up button, they should be taken to a view that lets them "sign up" for the newsletter (that will never come :-) ) of the restaurant. The sign up form should ask for the following information: first name, last name, email address, and phone number. It should also ask the user to specify the menu number that's their favorite dish. (The menu number is the short_name attribute of each menu item).

Everything in the form (except the short_name) must be validated through AngularJS validation we learned in this module. When the user clicks the Submit button (after all other fields are validated), try to retrieve the menu item the user specified as their favorite through the following REST endpoint https://coursera-jhu-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/menu_items/{category_short_name}/menu_items/{menu_number}.json. For example, for menu item L1, you will have to construct the URL of https://coursera-jhu-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/menu_items/L/menu_items/0.json. (Alternatively, if you prefer, you can simply retrieve the entire list of menu items with the endpoint of https://coursera-jhu-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/menu_items.json and traverse that tree in JS instead) If the server returns an null, you will know that the item name specified is not valid. If that's the case, display a message next to the favorite choice saying No such menu number exists. (See bonus for more)

If everything is valid, save the user's preference somewhere in your client app such that you can retrieve it in another view/component/controller/etc. (Hint: think service). Once saved, display a message below the form saying Your information has been saved.

Task 2: When the user clicks on My Info button, they should be taken to another view where it shows them their "registered" information, including the favorite menu item they picked. When showing the favorite menu item, display the picture of the menu item as well as its title and description.

If the user hasn't yet "registered" through the Sign Up button, simply display a message saying: Not Signed Up Yet. Sign up Now!. The words "Sign up Now!" should be a link to the same view as the Sign Up link points to
